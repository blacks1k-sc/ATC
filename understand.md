# Understanding Your ATC System Project - Complete Beginner's Guide

Welcome! This guide will walk you through every single file and folder in your ATC (Air Traffic Control) system project. Even if you've never worked with web development before, this guide will help you understand what everything does and why it exists.

## 🎯 What Is This Project?

Your ATC system is a **web application** that simulates an Air Traffic Control interface. It was originally built as a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript website, but has been converted to use modern web technologies:

- **Next.js 14** - A framework that makes building web applications easier
- **React** - A library for creating interactive user interfaces
- **TypeScript** - A programming language that adds extra safety to JavaScript

Think of it like upgrading from a simple calculator to a modern computer - same functionality, but much more powerful and maintainable!

**Why it exists**: TypeScript needs to know what your data looks like
**Think of it as**: A "blueprint" that defines what each piece of data contains

**Example of what's inside**:
```typescript
interface Aircraft {
  id: string;                    // Unique identifier
  callsign: string;              // Flight number (like "UAL245")
  type: string;                  // Aircraft type (like "A320")

    borderColor: string;
    content: string;
  };
}
```

**Note**: This is the only file in the `src/types/` directory, containing all TypeScript interface definitions for the ATC system.

## 🔄 How Everything Works Together

1. **User visits your website** → `page.tsx` loads
2. **Page renders** → `ATCSystem.tsx` component starts
3. **ATCSystem manages everything** → Coordinates all other components
4. **Components display data** → Header, Radar, Ground, Panels, Communications
5. **User interacts** → Clicks buttons, triggers functions in ATCSystem
6. **System updates** → Components re-render with new data
7. **Cycle continues** → Real-time updates, animations, emergency simulations

## 🎯 Key Concepts for Beginners

### **What is a Component?**
A component is like a small, reusable piece of your application. Think of it like a LEGO block - you can use the same block in different places, and you can combine many blocks to build something bigger.

### **What is State?**
State is like the "memory" of your application. It remembers things like:
- Is the system running?
- What time is it?
- Where are the aircraft?
- Is there an emergency?

### **What is TypeScript?**
TypeScript is like JavaScript with extra safety features. It helps catch errors before they happen and makes your code more reliable.

### **What is Next.js?**
Next.js is like a toolkit that makes building React applications easier. It handles things like:
- Routing (moving between pages)
- Building and optimizing your code
- Server-side rendering
