# Complete Project Explanation: AI Air Traffic Control System

## 🎯 What This Project Is

This is a comprehensive **AI Air Traffic Control (ATC) simulation system** that recreates the look, feel, and functionality of a real air traffic control operations center. It's a modern web application that simulates how air traffic controllers manage aircraft in real-time, complete with radar displays, communication logs, ground operations, and emergency scenarios.

Think of it as a **digital flight simulator for air traffic controllers** - it provides a realistic training environment or demonstration system that shows how modern ATC systems work.

## 🏗️ Overall Architecture

The project is built as a **full-stack web application** with three main components:

1. **Frontend (Next.js)**: The user interface that air traffic controllers interact with
2. **Backend (Node.js/TypeScript)**: The server that handles data and business logic
3. **Data Pipeline (Python)**: A system that collects and processes real aircraft data
